title: Plotting a type safe DAG
author: Mathias Frithiofsson

I am currently exploring how graphs may be expressed using Haskell. 

The goals is to define a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) or maybe a POSET.

Stumbled upon Alga which is library that defines an algebra for expressing graphs.

Acyclic AdjacencyMap.
